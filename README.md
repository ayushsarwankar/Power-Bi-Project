# Description 

This project involves developing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for bank loan analysis, utilizing advanced SQL and Power BI techniques. The process started with data extraction and cleaning, where SQL queries were used to efficiently organize and manipulate large datasets. Once the data was transformed, it was imported into Power BI, where sophisticated visualizations were created to examine key metrics such as loan approval rates, customer demographics, and risk factors. The resulting dashboard is interactive and user-friendly, providing stakeholders with valuable insights and a clear snapshot of the bankâ€™s loan portfolio. This project underscores the effective application of data analytics tools to enhance strategic decision-making in the financial services sector.
